# SpeechMaster
SpeechMaster is a powerful application that polishes your public communication skills by analysing your speeches on various parameters like filler words usage, pronunciation, pace, pitch, etc., 
The mirror doesn't judge you and neither does our app; but indeed it is a powerful tool using which you can analyse your public communication and presentation delivery skills
The app provides the user to do practice like in front of the mirror but the mirror neither modifies your script, nor does it analyse your speech, and nor does it asks questions to you based on your speech;
With the following advantages we are set to beat the traditional mirror method with all its advantages alongwith some cutting edge technologies like Apple Intelligence leveraging complex Machine Learning algorithms.
The app is pretty easy to use; there is only one single tab that has complete flow of the application; One single button for practicing sessions having a completely straight forward flow makes the app user friendly.
The Practice feature includes Script Generation feature that uses Apple Intellingence to generate scripts for presentations and public speaking.
The QnA feature included in the Script Section makes the user familiar with real world QnA sessions after presentations 
There is column on landing page where the user can watch great speakers delivering their presentations and get adaptation tips from that.
